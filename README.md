# TasksToDo
A to-do list app

I created a to-do list web application using ExpressJS for the backend along with a NoSQL database that is MongoDB. I have provided a user authentication system using PassportJS, which is an NPM library, thus giving users the ability to maintain their own to-do lists. 

You can add and delete tasks. While adding tasks you can mention the title, deadline and description of the task.
